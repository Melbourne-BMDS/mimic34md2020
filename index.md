# Introduction to Clinical Data Science Research with MIMIC III


The [Centre for the Digital Transformation of Health](https://mdhs.unimelb.edu.au/our-organisation/institutes-centres-departments/habic) and the [Melbourne Centre for Data Science](https://science.unimelb.edu.au/mcds) is offering a short course introducing students in the health sciences to data-driven clinical research using the [MIMIC III data set](https://mimic.physionet.org/). MIMIC III is a research database containing the de-identified medical records for roughy 60 000 ICU patients. It is perhaps the most valuable publicly available resource for conducting retrospective clinical research.

By participating in this course, students will be able to...

- Clinical Data
    - Describe the importance of data warehousing for clinical research
    - Create patient cohorts by defining phenotypes and executing queries to extract data for these cohorts
- Data Analytics
    - Apply statistical and visual analytics to gain insight from clinical data.
- Artificial Intelligence for Medicine
    - Use natural language processing to extract information from clinical text
    - Build and evaluate machine learning models for predicting disease states or patient outcomes
    
## Fees

There is no cost for this course. The course is open to all students and staff at the University of Melbourne interested in performing data-driven clinical research. Some basic knowledge of clinical healthcare is assumed. 

## Dates and Times

- The course will run from Monday 29 June through Thursday 2 July.
- Synchronous sessions will start at 9:00 AM

## Course Format

The course will be taught online with Zoom using a combination of synchronous and asynchronous sessions. The course will address the research question: _Can we predict hospital mortality?_ Students will use Python, [a leading programming language for data science](https://www.analyticsinsight.net/top-10-data-science-programming-languages-for-2020/), via [Juptyer notebooks](https://towardsdatascience.com/the-complete-guide-to-jupyter-notebooks-for-data-science-8ff3591f69a4). Students will only need access to a computer with a web browser. No specialized software is needed.

## Pre-requisites

Prior to starting the course, the students must have completed the following three items:

- Complete the [Massachusetts Institute of Technology Affiliates](https://www.citiprogram.org/index.cfm?pageID=154&icat=0&ac=0) ethics training. Completion of this course is necessary in order to be granted access to the MIMIC III data set.
- [Submit request](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/) for access to MIMIC III.
- Complete the [DataCamp free Introduction to Python course](https://learn.datacamp.com/courses/intro-to-python-for-data-science)
- [Create a Google Cloud account](https://cloud.google.com/) (we may not use this, if we get the database instantiated at the MRC)

## Enrollment

- Enrollment is limited to 40 students.

- Registration is done through eventbrite.com.au. For further information about the course or for a link to the registration site, e-mail Dr. Chapman at <brian.chapman@unimelb.edu.au>.
