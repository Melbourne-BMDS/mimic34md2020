# Example Research Projects using MIMIC III

Daniel Capurro has used the MIMIC III data set to perform _processing mining_ to discover optimal therapeutic pathways. Brian Chapman has used MIMIC III to develop natural language processing algorithms for medical text.

One way to get familiar with the kinds of research project that are being done with MIMIC III is to browse the [Physionet challanges](https://physionet.org/challenge/). We will be using data similar to that for the [WiDS (Women in Data Science) Datathon 2020: ICU Mortality Prediction](https://physionet.org/content/widsdatathon2020/1.0.0/).

## Publications 

- The MIMIC III website keeps a non-comprehensive list of [publications](https://mimic.physionet.org/about/publications/) using MIMIC III
- You can do a PubMed search for papers citing the original MIMIC III publication. Follow this [link](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27219127/) and click on the "Cited By" button on the right.
- MIMIC III is an update of MIMIC II, which will also have a publication history.
